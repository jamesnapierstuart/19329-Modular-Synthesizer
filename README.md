19329-Modular-Synthesizer
=========================
To achieve this task I implemented wavetable synthesis through look-up table waveform calculations and sample based wavetable creations, within a modular environment. Inspired by such programs as Max/MSP and Hadron I aimed to carry out these types of wavetable synthesis with modulation synthesis, achieved by creating a graphical environment to patch outputs of modules to inputs of others all within SuperCollider.
Three main aims were set; first to take a new approach to wavetable creation that differs from a drawing input or straight forward pre-calculated table values. Second to implement sample-based wavetable synthesis and third to create a modular system that allows these different synthesis techniques to interact with each other i.e. an environment that allows for ring, amplitude and frequency modulation implementation.
Working on the sample level to carry out Digital Signal Processing (DSP).
